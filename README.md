Carcinoma is a Python application, developed in Jupyter Notebook platform, built on top of the Keras framework, that helps doctors classify breast tumors as benign or malignant, by using some simple statistical methods of Machine Learning and Uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. There is a total of three statistical models provided in this project, one is the model which applies the Logistic Regression method, and the two others apply the Softmax Regression method. Here I have conducted a small study on how different predictive models can deliver different performances in breast tumor prediction through Deep Learning.
